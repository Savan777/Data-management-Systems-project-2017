* Twitter data collector

This project served as the final design project for Data Management(SOFE 3700)
course during the semester of *Fall2017*

* To run a demo of the project

 - Install *python 2.7*
 - Install *PostgreSQL*
 - Install *pgAdmin*
 - Install python dependencies using =pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt=
 - Create a database =TwitterBackup=
 - Use =root= as username and for password use =root=
 - Now from Database backup folder restore the backup file, to
   populate a sample database.
 - Now change directory to FrontEndAPI and run the *Flask* server using =python web.py=
 - Now you can fire up the localhost server running on the =port:5000= and use the demo

* How to add more data into the database than the backup

- To add more data you need to run the *getTweet.py* file that is in the RawData folder
- Once it is runed you will get an updated csv file called data.csv that is in that folder
- You need to run the *populate.py* file and it will append the new tweets to the database,
  make sure that you have demo already setup.
- If you want to replace the data then you can modify the lines 22-25 in the populate.py file
  change =if_exists = 'append'= change to =if_exists = 'replace'=
